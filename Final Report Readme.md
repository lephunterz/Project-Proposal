1.1 INTRODUCTION OF THE WEB APPLICATION 
As Malaysia growing to be one of the tourists destination in Southeast Asia, there has been a good improvement in increasing amount of hotels in Malaysia. Tourism sector has been recognized to produce the biggest income as we received a lot of visitors from inside and outside of Malaysia. In this context, ICT based products and development help the hotels to enhance the efficiency in handling information and improve the customer service experience. ICTs actually were used in the tourism industry from late seventies in the form of Computerized Reservation System and Global Distribution System. For our project, we are making a system in storing and organizing the information of customers that made registrations, which is Hotel Registration System. Due to the rapid development of technology such as Information and Communication Technologies, this system can be applied in the tourism industry in order to ease the management of the hotels in Malaysia as well as to increase the customer satisfaction due to faster and more efficient system.
1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
1.2.1 Background of the problem 
In Malaysia, there are about 4,750 hotels according to the statistics in 2019. Some of the hotels are gaining their international customers but the registration system is only implemented by few renowned hotels. So, our team decided to create hotel registration system as our project that are required in the tourism industry and can be implemented not only for the big and popular hotels but also for motels, resorts and another cheap hotels.
1.2.2 Problem Statement 
We usually heard on the data breach which the existing applications does not stress this issue. Increasing the security might makes customers trust and satisfied with the services. Administration of the hotel have limitations in storing and organizing the customers’ information. The admin can insert and delete the data but no update features which they cannot update any information of the data. In fact, customer should have rights to update their information. Not all employees can access the existing system that might result in difficulty to liase the customers’ details. For example, house-keeping unit might need to add extra requests that are requested from the customers into the system but they do it in manual way which are less efficient. The outdated data should be erased or deleted to increase the capacity of the storage. We might not want to store data of 20 years ago. Employee might have difficulty in viewing the customer’s details which the existing system are not well sorted and organized.
1.3 WEB APPLICATION OBJECTIVE 
Only authorised admin can fully make alterations on the customer’s information. Wrong id and password will not get the access. Admin and authorised employee can insert, update and delete the customer’s information. The employee also have the access to update the customer’s details that are suits with their unit of work. All the employee can view the order and customer’s details and make updates if necessary. Employee can filter and sort the data according to date, floor level and category which can ease their job in monitoring the customers.
1.4 WEB APPLICATION FEATURES
1.4.1 Scope Login and Logout feature 
Where we only give access to the authorised employee only (User Authentication). Insert feature - where we can add a new set of data (registration phase). Update feature - where we can update any information on the customer’s data including the extra requests that are requested from the customer. Delete feature - where we can delete any outdated and unwanted data. View feature - where we can view the customer’s information as well as if we want to sort the customers according to date, floor level and category.
1.4.2 Targeted User 
This system is for any hotel businesses as well as motels, resorts and other suitable businesses. This system is for administrations and employee of the hotel only, which we want to stress on the registering, storing and organizing the customer’s data. This system is for all department inside the businesses.
1.4.3 Specific Platform 
We will use Servlet, JSP and JavaBean for this project. We will also use JDBC for storing and organizing the customer’s data. Besides, we will be using the Tomcat Server and its technologies to fulfill the development. We will use Model View Controller concept for the execution of this project.
